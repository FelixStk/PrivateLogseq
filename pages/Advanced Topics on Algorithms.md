		- parallel sorting (sorting networks),
		- advanced tree-structures (Fibonacci heaps, B-Trees, disjoint sets),
		- approximation algorithms,
		- data structures (range minimum queries, lowest common ancestor, interval union-nd, level ancestor, applications to string algorithms),
		- other topics: Hashing and Dictionaries, Young tableaux, geometric algorithms (convex hull), number-theoretic algorithms

- # Basics
	- [[Computational Model - RAM]] -> TODO: Card
	- [[ Big   O   notation]] -> TODO: Card
	- [[Master Theorem]] -> Exercise on lecture slides 01 (TODO)
	- Toy Problems (Tutorial)
		- Subarray of Maximum Sum
		- Longest Increasing Subsequence
- # Sorting and Order Statistics:
	- ## Sorting in Linear Time
		- ### Sorting-based Methods
			- Recap: Quick-, Merge-, Heap- and Insertion-Sort
			- Lower Bounds for Comparison Sort (in comparisons)
		- ### Non-comparison-based methods
			- Counting Sort
			- Radix Sort
			- Bucket Sort
	- ## Order Statistics
		- Minimum and Maximum
		- Median and Select(n)
	- ## Tutorial
		- Hashing:
			- https://sortingsearching.com/2020/05/21/hashing.html
			- https://sortingsearching.com/2020/06/28/hashing-part-2.html
		- Sorting:
			- Kirkpatrick-Reisch sorting https://sortingsearching.com/2020/06/06/kirkpatrick-reisch.html
			- Proof: $T(n)= T(\lceil n \rceil) + T(7n/10+6)= \mathcal O(n) = \mathcal O(n)$

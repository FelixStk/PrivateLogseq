- MSSP for Planar Graphs
  collapsed:: true
	- Multiple Source Shortest Paths (MSSP) [Klein, SODA 2005]
		- We can construct in **nearly-linear** time (in the size of the graph) a data structure that can report in **logarithmic** time the distance between any vertex on the infinite face and any vertex in the graph.
		- First developed for alignment grids [Schmidt, SICOMP 1998]
	- Ideas:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Have a Rectangle $P$ in Alignment grid, ask: What is the distance to the vertices on the right or bottom edge of the Rectangle
		- Have $P^{out}$ that extends to the bottom edge and the right edge of the Alignment grid and does not contain $P$. It contains the most right, lowest vertex of the Alignment gird.
		- Let's split the Alignment gird into pieces of side lengths $\Theta(\sqrt r)$
			- For each piece P, we denote the set of "boundary vertices by $\partial P$
			- $|P| = \Theta(r)$
			- $|\partial P| = \Theta(\sqrt r)$
		- For each piece $P$, we store an MSSP data structure for $P$ and one of $P^{out}$
			- Pre-time: $N/r \cdot \tilde{O}(r+N) = \tilde{O}(N^2/r)$
			- We can answer a query in $O(\sqrt r \log n)$ time by trying all the boundary vertices of a piece that contains u, using MSSP
		- Next: We still store more information for u to speed up the query. It's distance to each of the relevant boundary vertices and

- Voronoi Diagrams on the Alignment Grid
  collapsed:: true
	- We are given weights for a set S of contiguous vertices of $\partial P$, called sites.
	- The Voronoi cell of each site consists of all vertices in P^{out} that are closer to it with respect to the additive distances
	- The voronoi cell or each site s is bounded by a "double-staircase" and has a bottom-right vertex $l(s)$
	- $\{(s,l(s):s\in S\}$ is all we store (for now) => Space: $O(N\cdot \sqrt r)$

- Reducing to 2 Candidate Sites
  collapsed:: true
	- Have $u\in P$ and $v\in P^{out}$. Ask for distance from u to v
	- The MSSP can answer whether v is left or right of a shortest-s-to l(s) path in logarithmic time.
		- Choose tow candidate sites:
			- remove sites to the lift of the site with the leftmost path right (from the view of that path) to v
			- remove sites to the right of the site with the rightmost path left (from the view of that path) to v
			- do binary search
	- So up to now we have:
		- Query time: $O(\log^2 n)$. We first compute two candidates, and when compute the distance to each of them using the MSSP structures.
		- | Component      | Prep-time | Space |
		  | Internal MSSPs | $N/r \cdot \tilde{O}(r)$       | $N/r \cdot \tilde{O}(r)$   |
		  | External MSSPs   | $N/r \cdot \tilde{O}(N)$ | $N/r \cdot \tilde{O}(N) $|
		  | Voronoi diagrams   | $N \cdot \tilde{O}(\sqrt r)$ | $N \cdot O(\sqrt r)$|
		  | Total   | $\tilde{O}(N^2/r + N \cdot \sqrt r)$ | $\tilde{O}(N^2/r+N \cdot \sqrt r)$|
		- Set r=2/3
		- Next we show how to construct each VD in time roughly proportional to the number of sites.

	- We can decompose the boundary using $\tilde{O}(|S|)$ site-to-vertex distance queries via binary search
	  collapsed:: true
		- We know that each colr appears in a contiguous interval, and the order of those intervals.
		- We first check using $|S|$ queryies the color of the middle vertex.
		- Our palette is then split, with the color of the middle vertex inherited by both sides.
		- We repeat this procedure $\log(n)$ times.
		- In very level, each color is active in at most two intervals.
		- Hence, the algorithm makes $\leq 2|S| \cdot \log n$ queries

	- This yields an algorithm that uses $\tilde{O}(|S|^2)$ site-vertex distance queries in total: decompose the graph into 2 rectangles and recursively zoo min to interesting ones. [Split the rectangle recursively until there is only one color it int then calculate the distance, There are O(S) constant size peaces. For each of them we pay a nearly lines number of side to vertex distance queries.]
	- Now: Remove quadratic dependency by disregarding irrelevant sites in recursion.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Sites whose cells do not touch the rectangle. E.g. the blue site (no. 3)
		- If there are three sites that "enter" and "exit" the rectangle next to each other, we can remove the middle one. E.g. the brown site (no. 2)
		- In each rectangle $\square$, we consider $O(|L \cap \square)$ sites in our binary search.

		- Finally, we check all candidates using our MSSP data structures. Query time: $O(\log^2 n)$
		- By setting $r=\sqrt N$ and $R=N^3/4$, we get $\tilde{O} (N^{5/4})$ prep-time
		- Using $t$ levels (instead of just two like above), with piece-sizes $r_1=\Theta_1,...,r_t=\Theta_t$: query time $\tilde O (2^t)$, space $\tilde O(N \cdot \sum_i \frac{r_{i+1}}{r_i})$ and prep-time $\tilde O(\mathrm{space} * 2^t)$
		- Final result: Setting $r_1=\Theta(1),...,r_t=\Theta(N)$, we get query time $\log^{2+o(1)}n$, space $N^{1+o(1)}$ and prep-time $N^{1+o(1)}$
- Open questions:
  collapsed:: true
	- How close to $O(N)$ prep-time, $O(1)$ query time can we get?
	- Further investigate the space vs query time tradeoff
	- Do their ideas extend to any subclass of planar graphs?

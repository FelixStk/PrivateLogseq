	- $f,g: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$
		- $f = \mathcal O (g(n))$
			- means that $f$ is bounded above by $g$ (up to a constant factor) asymptotically.
			- More formally: for sufficiently large $n$, we have $f (n) \leq k \cdot g(n)$ for some positive constant $k$.
		- $f = \Omega(g(n))$
			- means that $f$ is bounded below by $g$ asymptotically.
			- More formally: for sufficiently large $n$, we have $f(n) \geq k \cdot g(n)$ for some positive constant $k$.
		- $f = \Theta (g(n))$
			- means that $f$ is bounded both from above and below by $g$ asymptotically.
			- More formally: for sufficiently large $n$, we have $k_1 \cdot g(n) \leq f (n) \leq \cdot k_2 \ g(n)$ for some positive constants $k_1$; $k_2$.
		- $f = o(g(n))$
			- means that $f$ is dominated by $g$ asymptotically.
			- More formally: for every positive number $k$ and for sufficiently large $n=n(k)$, we have $f (n) \leq k \cdot g(n)$
		- $f = \omega(g(n))$
			- means that $f$ dominates $g$ asymptotically.
			- More formally: for every positive number $k$ and for sufficiently large $n=n(k)$, we have $f(n) \geq k \cdot g(n)$

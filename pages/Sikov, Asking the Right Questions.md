- ## Introduction
	- ### Def. Qualitative Research
		- Denzin and Lincoln, 2003: “Qualitative research involves an interpretive, naturalistic approach to the world. This means that qualitative researchers study things in their natural settings attempting to make sense of, or interpret, phenomenon in terms of the meanings people bring to them.”
	- ### Strengths of Qualitative Research
		- Gain *insider perspectives* into issues that are often missed (subtleties and complexities)
		- Building *relationships, causes, and effects, and dynamic processes* surrounding issues
		- *Allows for ambiguities/contradictions* in the data, which reflect social reality and duality behind many major issues
		- *Descriptive, narrative* style which provides rich data
	- ### Limitations of Qualitative Research
		- *Lengthy and complicated designs,* which do not draw large samples
		- *Validity* of reliability of subjective data
		- Difficult to *replicate* study because of central role of the researcher and context
		- Data analysis and interpretation is *time consuming*
		- *Subjective* – open to misinterpretation
	- ### Types of Qualitative Methodology
		- in depth interview
		- focus groups discussion
		- observation
	- ### Developing your qualitative interview/focus group guide
		- Typically qualitative visits are *unstructured or semi-structured*
		- Does not need to be *read verbatim* (dt. wortgetreu)
		- Interviewer needs a **very good understanding** of the *research question* and *probe*
		- Create a certain amount of order on topic areas that your question covers and then follow in a
		  reasonable order (but you can jump around depending on how the participant leads the
		  conversation)
		- *Types of questions*
			- Background
			- Behaviors or experiences
			- Opinions or beliefs
			- Knowledge
			- Sensory experiences
		- Focus on *research question* and formulate questions that are concretely oriented to answer to it (but avoid specific questions)
		- Use *language that is relevant and understandable* to participants

	- | Do's      | Don'ts |
	  | :---        |    ---:   |
	  | Do know your guide    | Don't ask closed question       |
	  | Do ask open ended questions   | Don't interrupt / tell your own story        |
	  | Do leave your assumptions at the door| Don't lead/ put words in their mouths |
	  | Do take nots (also tone/impression)| Don't judge|
	  | Do validate and empower | Don't be afraid to re-direct|
	  | Do maintain eye contact|  Don't be afraid of the silence|
	  | Do rephrase questions||
	  | Do Probe Probe Probe||

	- ### Qualitative Data Collection
		- Audio recordings
		- Memo-ing– reflective notes about what you are learning from the data
		- Interviewers impressions, thoughts
		- Drawings, Pictures
		- Journal entries
		- Interview transcriptions
	- ### Saturation (when do i stop interviewing)?
		- when information begins to repeat itself, based on the reseach topic and variation in study participants
		- may add new topic / issue in subsequent interview
		- most new information about your study will be gained in the intial interview of focus group discussion
- ## Qualitative Analysis Approaches
	- ### Qualitative Analysis Approaches
		- No specific method – different methods are based on different philosophical approaches (e.g. linguistics, analytic philosophy, structuralism)
		- Categorisation
		- Recognising relationships and developing the categories you are using to facilitate this
		- Developing and testing hypotheses to reach conclusion
		- Different approaches can be used together
	- ### Qualitative Analysis Process
		- Process
			- Identifying, coding, categorizing themes then:
				- *Thematic Analysis*
				- *Grounded Theory*
					- The grounded theory approach is a qualitative research method that uses a
					  systematic set of procedures to develop an inductively derived grounded theory
					  about a phenomenon
					- contains inductive and deductive thinking
					- Questions: What's going on, What is the main problem of the participants, and how are they trying to solve it?
					- Grounded theory is based around developing an overarching theory that explains the findings within the data
					- Emphasizes systematic analysis of data (theoretical smapling, coding, theoretical saturation, constant comparison)
					- Codes -> Concepts -> Categories -> Theory
				- *Discourse Analysis*
		- *Coding*: Naming the segments of your data with descriptive words or category names
			- Kinds of Codes: Code, Co-occurring codes
			- Inter-coder reliability: Consistency among different coders
		- *Relational/Axial codes*
			- Look for patterns and connection both within and between categories
				- How themes relate
				- Direction of relationship
				- What factors contribute to the issue
				- Develop a table or matrix to illustrate relationships across categories
		- ### Analyse Data
			- *Thematic Analysis* – Inductive method of identifying and analyzing themes/patterns.
			- *Content Analysis* – Quantify and analyze the presence, meaning and relationships of certain words, themes, or concepts.
			- *Discourse Analysis* (Conversational analysis)- Analyze patterns of speech, language use
			- *Ethnography* (Participant observation) – Analyze social setting, customs and cultur
		- ### Visualizing Codes, Categories and themes
			- *Word Cloud:* displaying word frequencies
			- *Concept Map:* displaying relationship between categories and themes

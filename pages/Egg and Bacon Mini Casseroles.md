	- # Directions
	- 1. Meal Plan Tip: Make this recipe at the beginning of the week and eat for breakfast every week. Serving size is 2 mini casseroles.
	  2. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Spray one 12-well muffin tin (or two 6-well muffin tins) with cooking oil spray, set set aside.
	  3. Put thawed spinach into a mesh strainer, and squeeze out as much excess water as possible. Set spinach aside.
	  4. In a large mixing bown, coat bread with olive oil. Add spinach, cheese, green onions, garlic powder, salt, pepper and bacon. Toss the bread mixture until well combined.
	  5. In the same bowl, beat the eggs and stir in the milk. Pour the mixture over the bread in teh muffin tin, trying your best to evenly divide the egg-and milk mixture into each muffin well.
	  6. Bake the casseroles for 30-40 minutes, or until the bread on top is golden and crispy and the centers are set. Test by poking a skewer into one of casseroles, and see if it comes out clean.
	  7. Allow casseroles to coll before serving
